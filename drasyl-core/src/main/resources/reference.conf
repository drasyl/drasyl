  # The messages that drasyl nodes send to each other are JVM objects. Message passing between nodes
  # living on the same JVM is straightforward. It is done via reference passing. However, messages
  # that must leave the JVM to reach a node running on a different host must go through some form of
  # serialization (i.e., the objects must be converted to and from byte arrays).
  #
  # For drasyl to know which Serializer to use for what, you bind java classes to implementations of
  # the org.drasyl.serialization.Serializer you wish to use.
  #
  # By default, drasyl serializes only java primitives and strings. Additional classes must be
  # enabled manually. Please note the potential security implications below.
  #
  # A reckless implementation of a permitted class can leave the entire application and all
  # executing machines vulnerable to remote code execution.
  #
  # An attacker is in general interested in all "non-pure" methods, which have promising side
  # effects. A method is "pure" if:
  #   - The execution of the function has no side effects, and
  #   - the return value of the function depends only on the input parameters passed to the function.
  #
  # For example, a vulnerability could be a setter or getter that connects to a database.
  # A vulnerable class is for example the ch.qos.logback.core.db.DriverManagerConnectionSource.
  # An attacker can choose the URL arbitrarily. By calling getConnection,
  # Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and DOS attacks can occur.
