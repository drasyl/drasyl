/**
 * A common annotation to declare that annotated elements can be {@code null} under some
 * circumstance. Leverages JSR 305 meta-annotations to indicate nullability in Java to common tools
 * with JSR 305 support and used by Kotlin to infer nullability of the API.
 *
 * <p>Should be used at parameter, return value, and field level. Methods override should
 * repeat parent {@code @Nullable} annotations unless they behave differently.
 *
 * <p>Adapted from {@link io.micrometer.core.lang.Nullable}
