/**
 * Indicates that the annotated handler method ({@link Handler#onInbound(MigrationHandlerContext, Address, Object,
 * CompletableFuture)}, {@link Handler#onOutbound(MigrationHandlerContext, Address, Object, CompletableFuture)},
 * {@link Handler#onEvent(MigrationHandlerContext, Event, CompletableFuture)} or {@link
 * Handler#onException(MigrationHandlerContext, Exception)}) in {@link Handler} will not be invoked by
 * the {@link Pipeline} and so <strong>MUST</strong> only be used when the {@link Handler} method
 * does nothing except forward to the next {@link Handler} in the pipeline.
 * <p>
 * Note that this annotation is not {@linkplain Inherited inherited}. If a user overrides a method
 * annotated with {@link Skip}, it will not be skipped anymore. Similarly, the user can override a
 * method not annotated with {@link Skip} and simply pass the event through to the next handler,
 * which reverses the behavior of the supertype.
 * <b>The skippable method MUST be implemented always because some environments prohibit the
 * execution of reflections. In this case the method implementation is executed, also if it is
 * annotated with {@link Skip}</b>.
