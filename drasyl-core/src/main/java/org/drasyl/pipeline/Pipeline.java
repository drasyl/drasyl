/**
 * A list of {@link Handler}s which handles or intercepts inbound events and outbound operations of
 * a {@link org.drasyl.DrasylNode}. {@link Pipeline} implements an advanced form of the
 * <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/interceptingfilter-142169.html">Intercepting
 * Filter</a> pattern to give a user full control over how an event is handled and how the {@link
 * Handler}s in a pipeline interact with each other. This implementation is very closely based on
 * the netty implementation.
 *
 * <h3>Creation of a pipeline</h3>
 * <p>
 * Each per DrasylNode exists one pipeline and it is created automatically when a new node is
 * created.
 *
 * <h3>How an event flows in a pipeline</h3>
 * <p>
 * The following diagram describes how I/O events are processed by {@link Handler}s in a {@link
 * Pipeline} typically. An I/O event are handled by a {@link Handler}  and be forwarded to its
 * closest handler by calling the event propagation methods defined in {@link HandlerContext}, such
 * as {@link HandlerContext#passInbound(Address, Object, CompletableFuture)} and {@link
 * HandlerContext#passOutbound(Address, Object, CompletableFuture)} .
 *
 * <pre>
 *                                                 I/O Request
 *                                            via {@link HandlerContext}

 * <p>
 * An inbound event is handled by the handlers in the bottom-up direction as shown on the left side
 * of the diagram. A handler usually handles the inbound data generated by the I/O thread on the
 * bottom of the diagram. The inbound data is often read from a remote peer via the actual input
 * operation. If an inbound event goes beyond the top handler, it is passed to the application.
 * <p>
 * An outbound event is handled by the handler in the top-down direction as shown on the right side
 * of the diagram. A handler usually generates or transforms the outbound traffic such as write
 * requests.
 * <p>
 * For example, let us assume that we created the following pipeline:
 * <pre>
 * {@link Pipeline} p = ...;
 * p.addLast("1", new HandlerA());
 * p.addLast("2", new HandlerB());
 * p.addLast("3", new HandlerC());
 * p.addLast("4", new HandlerD());
 * p.addLast("5", new HandlerE());
 * </pre>
 * In the given example configuration, the handler evaluation order is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 when an event
 * goes inbound. When an event goes outbound, the order is 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
 *
 * <h3>Forwarding an event to the next handler</h3>
 * <p>
 * As you might noticed in the diagram, a handler has to invoke the event propagation methods in
 * {@link HandlerContext} to forward an event to its next handler. Those methods include:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Inbound event propagation methods:
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>{@link HandlerContext#passInbound(Address, Object, CompletableFuture)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link HandlerContext#passEvent(Event, CompletableFuture)}</li>
 *     <li>{@link HandlerContext#passException(Exception)}</li>
 *     </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>Outbound event propagation methods:
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>{@link HandlerContext#passOutbound(Address, Object, CompletableFuture)} </li>
 *     </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Thread safety</h3>
 * <p>
 * A {@link Handler} can be added or removed at any time because a {@link Pipeline} is thread safe.
 *
 * <li>But for every invocation of:
 *       <ul>
 *       <li>{@link Pipeline#processInbound(Address, Object)}</li>
 *       <li>{@link Pipeline#processInbound(Event)}</li>
 *       <li>{@link Pipeline#processOutbound(Address, Object)}</li>
 *       </ul>
 * </li>
 * the invocation is scheduled in the {@link DrasylSchedulerUtil}, therefore the order of
 * invocations can't be guaranteed. You have to ensure by yourself, that your handlers are thread-safe
 * if you need it. Also, you have to ensure the order of messages, if you need it.
