/**
 * This class provides the functionality to either accept or reject new inbound messages.
 * <p>
 * You should inherit from this class if you would like to implement your own inbound messages
 * filter. Basically you have to implement {@link #accept(MigrationHandlerContext, Address, Object)}
 * to decided whether you want to pass through or drop a message.
 * <p>
 * Furthermore overriding {@link #messageRejected(MigrationHandlerContext, Address, Object,
 * CompletableFuture)} gives you the flexibility to respond to rejected messages.
 * <p>
 * This class will automatically call {@link ReferenceCounted#release()} on rejected messages and
 * complete the corresponding future.
