     * caught and wrapped in a new {@link IllegalArgumentException} object, which is then thrown.

     * the given string is a legal URL, for example for URL constants declared within a program, and
     * so it would be considered a programming error for the string not to parse as such. The
     * constructors, which throw {@link MalformedURLException} directly, should be used in
     * situations where a URL is being constructed from user input or from some other source that
     * may be prone to errors.  </p>

     *                                  fails to comply with the specific syntax of the associated
