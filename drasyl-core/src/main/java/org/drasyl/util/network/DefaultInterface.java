     * In steps 1-4 below, PPP and loopback interfaces are skipped.

     *    and a non link-local IP address, is picked.

     * 2. If none is found, then the first interface that has at least an
     *    IPv4 address, and an IPv6 address is picked.
     *
     * 3. If none is found, then the first interface that has at least a
     *    non link local IP address is picked.
     *
     * 4. If none is found, then the first non loopback and non PPP interface
     *    is picked.
     *
     * 5. If none is found then first PPP interface is picked.
     *
     * 6. If none is found, then the first loopback interface is picked.
