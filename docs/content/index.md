drasyl [d Åazy:l] is an [open-source](https://github.com/drasyl-overlay/drasyl) general-purpose overlay network framework for rapid development of distributed P2P applications.

By using drasyl developers can fully concentrate on creating distributed applications.
With drasyl, boundaries between IP-based networks will be eliminated and secure communication channels between any two nodes will be provided.
Zero-configuration is required to use drasyl.
Developers can [run a new drasyl node](getting-started.md) without having to write configuration files or provide IP addresses of other peers.
