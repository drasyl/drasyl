drasyl is an [open-source](https://github.com/drasyl-overlay/drasyl) general-purpose overlay network framework for rapid development of distributed P2P applications.

By using drasyl developers can fully concentrate on creating distributed applications.
With drasyl, boundaries between IP-based networks will be eliminated and secure communication channels between any two nodes will be provided.
Zero-configuration is required to use drasyl.
Developers can [run a new drasyl node](getting-started.md) without having to write configuration files or provide IP addresses of other peers.

!!! info

    As drasyl is primarily developed for the research project
    [Smart Networks for Urban Participation (SANE)](https://sane.city/) and focuses on functionalities necessary for the project. However, drasyl is open to
    contributions made by the community.
