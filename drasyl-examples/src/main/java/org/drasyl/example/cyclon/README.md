# CYCLON Membership Management

This example implements the CYCLON membership protocol.

The protocol is described in:

> Unstructured P2P Overlays. J Netw Syst Manage 13, 197â€“217 (2005)

## Usage

1. Start a bootstrap
   peer: `mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.drasyl.example.cyclon.CyclonMembershipManagement"`
2. Wait for identity creation and then copy the peer address (`My address = ...`).
3. Start as many additional peers as you want. Replace `N` with a given unique number (e.g.,
   2, 3, 4, ...): `mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.drasyl.example.cyclon.CyclonMembershipManagement" -Didentity=cyclon-N.identity -Dexec.args="<bootstrap_address>"`
4. You will soon see that every peer's neighbor view will get populated.
