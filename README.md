# drasyl

drasyl [d Åazy:l] is a general-purpose overlay network framework for rapid development of distributed
P2P applications.

By using drasyl developers can fully concentrate on creating distributed applications. With drasyl,
boundaries between IP-based networks will be eliminated and secure communication channels between
any peers will be provided. Zero-configuration is required to use drasyl. Developers can run a new
drasyl node without having to write configuration files or provide IP addresses of peers.
