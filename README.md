# drasyl

drasyl is a general-purpose overlay network framework for rapid development of distributed P2P
applications.

By using drasyl developers can fully concentrate on creating distributed applications. With drasyl,
boundaries between IP-based networks will be eliminated and secure communication channels between
any peers will be provided. Zero-configuration is required to use drasyl. Developers can run a new
drasyl node without having to write configuration files or provide IP addresses of peers.

_As drasyl is primarily developed for the research project
[Smart Networks for Urban Participation (SANE)](https://sane.city/) and focuses on functionalities
necessary for the project. However, drasyl is open to contributions made by the community._
