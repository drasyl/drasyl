# drasyl-java

[drasyl-java](https://github.com/drasyl/drasyl) [d Åazy:l] is a high-performance framework for rapid development of distributed applications.

drasyl enables quick and easy development of high-performance distributed applications. Driven by a secure and low-latency overlay network protocol, drasyl provides any-to-any connectivity between all Internet-enabled devices.

To prevent developers from reinventing the wheel, drasyl-java provides extensions that address common challenges for distributed systems like identity/key management, resource discovery, and locality-aware message routing. By using drasyl-java, developers are unburdened of many usual tasks and can proceed directly with building their distributed application.
