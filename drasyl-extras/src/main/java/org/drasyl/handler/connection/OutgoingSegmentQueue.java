/**
 * Represents the outgoing segment queue that holds segments to be sent over a connection.
 * <p>
 * This class manages the queue of segments that are waiting to be sent over a connection. The queue
 * implements a first-in, first-out (FIFO) ordering, where segments are added to the end of the
 * queue and retrieved from the front of the queue. The queue is used by the sender to hold segments
 * that are waiting to be sent to the receiver. Segments are added to the queue as they are
 * generated by the application, and they are sent out by the sender according to the congestion
 * control algorithm and the available network resources.
